# Azure Drift Detection Service Architecture

## Overview

The Azure Drift Detection Service is designed to monitor and detect configuration changes in Azure resources. It provides a comprehensive solution for tracking configuration drift and maintaining infrastructure consistency.

## System Components

### 1. Core Components

#### DriftDetector

- Main component responsible for configuration collection and drift detection
- Handles Azure resource monitoring and comparison
- Manages snapshots and drift reports

#### API Service

- FastAPI-based REST API
- Exposes endpoints for drift detection operations
- Handles authentication and authorization

### 2. Data Storage

#### Snapshots

- JSON-based configuration snapshots
- Stored in `data/snapshots` directory
- Contains current state of Azure resources

#### Drift Reports

- JSON-based drift detection reports
- Stored in `data/drift` directory
- Contains detected changes and drift analysis

### 3. External Dependencies

#### Azure Services

- Azure Resource Manager
- Azure Monitor
- Azure Security Center
- Azure RBAC

#### Redis

- Used for caching and session management
- Improves performance and reduces Azure API calls

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration Collection**

   - Periodic polling of Azure resources
   - Collection of current configuration state
   - Storage of configuration snapshots

2. **Drift Detection**

   - Comparison of current and previous snapshots
   - Analysis of configuration changes
   - Generation of drift reports

3. **API Interaction**
   - Client requests through REST API
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Response with drift information

## Security Architecture

### Authentication

- Azure AD integration
- Service principal authentication
- Token-based access control

### Authorization

- Role-based access control
- Resource-level permissions
- API endpoint security

### Data Protection

- Encrypted storage
- Secure communication
- Audit logging

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling

- Stateless API design
- Redis-based session management
- Load balancing support

### Performance Optimization

- Caching mechanisms
- Asynchronous operations
- Batch processing

## Monitoring and Logging

### Health Monitoring

- Service health checks
- Resource availability monitoring
- Performance metrics

### Logging

- Application logs
- Audit trails
- Error tracking

## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization

- Docker-based deployment
- Container orchestration support
- Environment isolation

### Configuration Management

- Environment-based configuration
- Secret management
- Feature flags

## Integration Points

### Azure Integration

- Resource Manager API
- Monitor API
- Security Center API

### External Systems

- Monitoring systems
- Alerting systems
- Reporting tools
